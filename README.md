## How does it work?
A user can login using their Google ID or they can enjoy the app as a guest. The difference is that users who login can save their recipes.

1. A user enters an ingredient in the search box. They can click the plus button to generate another search box for as many ingredients they wish to add.

2. Once all of the ingredients have been added, the user clicks the search button.

3. A list of up to 10 different recipes is generated and the user can either click on one of these recipes to view it or add/delete ingredients and reapply the search to generate different recipes.

4. When the user clicks on a recipe they will see a variety of health and nutrition information displayed as well as the button the user can click to view the recipe.

5. Under the health and nutrition the user will have the opportunity to watch instructional videos based on the recipes they have selected. A search bar is provided if the user needs to refine the videos.

6. If the user wants to save their recipes they must login by first clicking the user icon at the top of the page. This will open a modal for the user to enter thier Google ID.

7. When a user who is logged in does a recipe search, they can click the empty heart icon in the corner of each displayed recipe to save their choice. The user may also delete their choices and saved meals by clicking the heart again.

8. When a user returns to Pocket Pantry and logs back in, they will see their saved meals in a side navigation they can activate with the hamburger menu icon at the top of the page. The users saved recipes will also be displayed as images at the bottom of the page where they can choose to view the recipe or delete it by un-clicking the red heart displayed on the recipe card.
